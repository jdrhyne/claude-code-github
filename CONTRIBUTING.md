### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Types:
- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build:` Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci:` Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore:` Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Run `npm run lint` to check for style issues

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Reference functions and classes with backticks
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep explanations clear and concise
- Update the README.md if your changes affect user-facing functionality
