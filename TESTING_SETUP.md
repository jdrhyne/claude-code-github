# üß™ Agent Monitoring Testing Setup

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Basic Function Test**

```bash
# Test CLI help (should show new monitoring commands)
npm run build && node dist/index.js --help

# Expected output should include:
# Commands:
#   monitor        Launch real-time agent monitoring dashboard
#   dashboard      Launch interactive dashboard with full controls  
#   stream         Stream agent events to console (minimal output)
```

### 2. **Stream Mode Test** (Recommended first test)

```bash
# Test stream mode with sample events
NODE_ENV=development node dist/index.js stream

# Expected: Should show sample events after a few seconds:
# üì° Starting event stream...
# 10:19:51 PM üîç Scanning project for changes... (100%)
# 10:19:53 PM üß† Analyzing changes: 3 new TypeScript files (85%)
# 10:19:55 PM üí° Suggesting: Commit monitoring infrastructure (92%)
```

### 3. **Dashboard Mode Test**

```bash
# Test interactive dashboard
NODE_ENV=development node dist/index.js monitor

# Expected: Full terminal UI with panels
# Use 'q' to quit, 'h' for help
```

## Comprehensive Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Stream Mode Variations

```bash
# Basic stream
node dist/index.js stream

# With filtering
node dist/index.js stream --filter analyzing,suggesting

# No colors (for logging)
node dist/index.js stream --no-color

# Development mode (with sample events)
NODE_ENV=development node dist/index.js stream
```

### Scenario 2: Dashboard Mode Variations

```bash
# Basic dashboard
node dist/index.js monitor

# Full-featured dashboard
node dist/index.js dashboard

# With specific project
node dist/index.js dashboard --project /Users/admin/Projects/claude-code-github

# Custom refresh rate
node dist/index.js monitor --refresh-rate 500

# Compact mode
node dist/index.js monitor --compact
```

### Scenario 3: Interactive Controls Testing

When in dashboard mode, test these keyboard shortcuts:

- `[p]` or `[space]` - Pause/Resume monitoring
- `[c]` - Clear activity log
- `[r]` - Refresh display
- `[h]` or `[?]` - Show help dialog
- `[q]` - Quit monitor

### Scenario 4: Error Handling

```bash
# Test invalid commands
node dist/index.js invalid-command

# Test invalid options
node dist/index.js stream --invalid-option

# Test without build
# (Delete dist folder and try running)
```

## Expected Behavior

### Stream Mode
- ‚úÖ Shows timestamped events with icons
- ‚úÖ Confidence percentages in parentheses
- ‚úÖ Reasoning steps indented with ‚îî‚îÄ
- ‚úÖ Color coding (unless --no-color)
- ‚úÖ Graceful exit with Ctrl+C

### Dashboard Mode
- ‚úÖ Four-panel layout (Status, Activity, Decision Tree, Controls)
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates
- ‚úÖ Interactive keyboard controls
- ‚úÖ Proper terminal cleanup on exit
- ‚úÖ Responsive to terminal resize

### Development Mode
- ‚úÖ Generates sample events automatically
- ‚úÖ Events appear at 1s, 3s, 5s intervals
- ‚úÖ Shows realistic agent workflow

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Installation & Setup
- [ ] `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] `node dist/index.js --help` shows monitoring commands
- [ ] `node dist/index.js --version` shows current version

### Stream Mode
- [ ] `node dist/index.js stream` starts successfully
- [ ] Shows startup message and instructions
- [ ] Accepts Ctrl+C to exit gracefully
- [ ] `--filter` option works correctly
- [ ] `--no-color` removes colors
- [ ] Development mode generates sample events

### Dashboard Mode
- [ ] `node dist/index.js monitor` launches UI
- [ ] Four panels are visible and properly formatted
- [ ] Status bar shows agent information
- [ ] Activity log accepts new events
- [ ] Keyboard controls work ([p], [c], [r], [h], [q])
- [ ] Help dialog displays and closes properly
- [ ] Terminal cleans up properly on exit

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid commands show helpful error messages
- [ ] Missing dependencies are reported clearly
- [ ] Terminal size issues are handled gracefully
- [ ] Network/file system errors don't crash

### Performance
- [ ] Dashboard refreshes smoothly (no flicker)
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable during long runs
- [ ] No significant CPU usage when idle
- [ ] Large number of events don't slow down UI

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Command not found" or module errors
**Solution:** Run `npm run build` first

### Issue: Dashboard appears garbled
**Solution:** 
- Ensure terminal supports Unicode
- Try `--no-color` flag
- Increase terminal size (minimum 80x24)

### Issue: No sample events in development
**Solution:** 
- Ensure `NODE_ENV=development` is set
- Wait 5-10 seconds for events to generate

### Issue: Dashboard doesn't respond to keyboard
**Solution:**
- Ensure terminal has focus
- Try different key combinations
- Check if terminal intercepts certain keys

### Issue: Colors don't show properly
**Solution:**
- Use `--no-color` flag
- Check terminal color support
- Try different terminal emulator

## Advanced Testing

### Testing with Real Projects

1. Navigate to an actual Git repository
2. Make some file changes
3. Run monitoring while using claude-code-github MCP tools
4. Observe real agent events (requires full MCP setup)

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Long-running test (let it run for 10+ minutes)
NODE_ENV=development node dist/index.js monitor

# Memory monitoring
# Check memory usage with Activity Monitor or htop
```

### Terminal Compatibility Testing

Test on different terminals:
- macOS Terminal
- iTerm2
- VS Code integrated terminal
- tmux/screen sessions

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All monitoring commands work without errors**  
‚úÖ **Interactive dashboard displays properly**  
‚úÖ **Stream mode shows formatted events**  
‚úÖ **Keyboard controls are responsive**  
‚úÖ **Sample events generate in development mode**  
‚úÖ **Help system works correctly**  
‚úÖ **Graceful exit and cleanup**  
‚úÖ **No crashes or hanging processes**  

## Reporting Issues
