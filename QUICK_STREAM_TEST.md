# 🚀 Quick Stream Test

## The stream IS working! 

You just need to:
1. **Open a new terminal** (to load the alias)
2. Run `claude-stream`
3. **Wait 3-5 seconds** for events to appear

## What You Should See:

```bash
$ claude-stream

🚀 Starting Claude Code GitHub Agent Monitor...
📡 Starting event stream...
Press Ctrl+C to quit
[wait 3 seconds...]
4:54:38 PM 🔍 Scanning project for changes... (100%)
4:54:40 PM 🧠 Analyzing changes: 3 new TypeScript files (85%)
  └─ Files are cohesive (all monitoring-related)
  └─ No breaking changes detected
  └─ Tests are passing
4:54:42 PM 💡 Suggesting: Commit monitoring infrastructure (92%)
  └─ High confidence in change quality
  └─ Feature branch is appropriate
  └─ Similar commits successful in past
```

## If claude-stream doesn't work:

### Use the direct command:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/Projects/claude-code-github
NODE_ENV=development node dist/index.js stream
```

### Or create a simpler alias:
```bash
echo "alias cs='NODE_ENV=development node /Users/admin/Projects/claude-code-github/dist/index.js stream'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
cs
```

## Understanding the Timing:

- **0-2 seconds**: Startup messages
- **3 seconds**: First event (Scanning)
- **5 seconds**: Second event (Analyzing)
- **7 seconds**: Third event (Suggesting)

Be patient - the events are timed to simulate real agent behavior!

## See Real Events (No Demo):

To see REAL events from actual development:
```bash
# Remove NODE_ENV to see real events
cd /Users/admin/Projects/claude-code-github
node dist/index.js stream

# Then make file changes in another terminal
```

The stream is working perfectly - you just need to wait a few seconds for the demo events to start!
