# Step 1: Ensure MCP server is running (in Claude Code)
# Step 2: Start monitoring
./start-monitoring.sh

# Choose option 1 for real events
# Choose option 2 for demo
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### During Normal Development:

1. **File Changes:**
   ```
   🔍 Scanning: /Users/admin/Projects/claude-code-github
   📁 Found 3 modified files
   ```

2. **Agent Analysis:**
   ```
   🧠 Analyzing: Changes appear to be bug fixes
   ├─ Files: error-handler.ts, logger.ts
   ├─ Confidence: 85%
   └─ Pattern: Error handling improvements
   ```

3. **Suggestions:**
   ```
   💡 Suggesting: Commit error handling improvements
   ├─ Confidence: 87%
   └─ Command: git commit -m "fix: improve error handling"
   ```

## 🔥 Try This Right Now

### Test 1: Make a Change and Watch
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start monitoring
claude-dashboard

# Terminal 2: Make a change
cd /Users/admin/Projects/claude-code-github
echo "// Test change" >> src/test.ts

# Watch the monitor react!
```

### Test 2: Use Claude Code
```bash
# With monitoring running, in another terminal:
claude-code "What's the status of my project?"

# Monitor shows Claude's analysis in real-time
```

## 🎮 Monitoring Controls

While dashboard is running:
- `p` - Pause/Resume
- `c` - Clear log
- `h` - Help
- `q` - Quit

## 🔍 Monitoring Specific Projects

### Your Most Active Projects:
```bash
# Monitor AgentCopy
claude-monitor monitor --project /Users/admin/Projects/AgentCopy

# Monitor claude-yes
claude-monitor monitor --project /Users/admin/Projects/claude-yes

# Monitor jdrhyne-me
claude-monitor monitor --project /Users/admin/Projects/jdrhyne-me
```

## 📈 Understanding Agent Confidence

The agent shows confidence levels for all decisions:

- **🟢 90%+** - Very confident, may auto-execute
- **🟡 70-89%** - Good confidence, suggests action
- **🟠 50-69%** - Moderate, asks for confirmation
- **🔴 <50%** - Low confidence, learning mode

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

**Not seeing events?**
1. Check if making changes in a monitored project
2. Ensure MCP server is running
3. Remove `NODE_ENV=development` for real events

**Want more events?**
1. Make file changes
2. Run git commands
3. Use Claude Code actively

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep monitoring open** while coding
2. **Watch patterns** - the agent learns your style
3. **Use stream mode** for less visual noise:
   ```bash
   claude-stream --filter suggesting,executing
   ```

4. **Monitor multiple projects** - open multiple terminals

## 🎯 What's Next?

1. Make some code changes and watch the agent respond
2. Try different types of changes (features, bugs, docs)
3. See how confidence changes based on patterns
4. Use Claude Code commands and watch them execute

The monitoring system shows you exactly what the AI agent is thinking and doing. Use it to understand, trust, and improve your AI-assisted development workflow!
