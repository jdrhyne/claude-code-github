# Changelog for v2.2.0

## Overview

Version 2.2.0 introduces a comprehensive Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, enhanced TypeScript support, improved security, and better monitoring capabilities. This release represents a major architectural improvement while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Major Features

### üèóÔ∏è Domain-Driven Design Architecture

- **Complete DDD Implementation**: Introduced bounded contexts for git-operations with clear separation of concerns
- **CQRS Pattern**: Implemented Command/Query Responsibility Segregation for better code organization
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Added domain events and event bus for decoupled communication
- **Value Objects**: Introduced type-safe value objects for branch names, commit messages, and repository IDs
- **Aggregate Roots**: Implemented repository aggregate with proper domain logic encapsulation

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security

- **Type Confusion Fix**: Resolved security vulnerability in query parameter handling
- **Type-Safe Query Parameters**: Implemented comprehensive type checking for Express.js ParsedQs
- **Input Validation**: Added proper validation for all user inputs

### üìä Improved Monitoring & Analytics

- **Agent Monitoring System**: Real-time dashboards for tracking autonomous agent activities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added performance tracking for all domain operations
- **Event Aggregation**: Better insights into development patterns and milestones
- **Learning System**: Enhanced feedback store for adaptive behavior

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **TypeScript ESLint v8**: Updated to latest TypeScript ESLint packages (v8.34.1)
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated all major dependencies including:
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: 0.24.3 ‚Üí 0.54.0
  - `openai`: 4.104.0 ‚Üí 5.6.0
  - `commander`: 13.1.0 ‚Üí 14.0.0
  - `express-rate-limit`: 7.5.0 ‚Üí 7.5.1
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and proper error propagation
- **Code Quality**: Fixed all ESLint errors and TypeScript compilation issues

## New Files & Modules

### Domain Layer
- `src/contexts/git-operations/domain/` - Core domain logic
- `src/contexts/git-operations/application/` - Application services and handlers
- `src/contexts/git-operations/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure implementations
- `src/shared/domain/` - Shared domain primitives (Entity, ValueObject, Result)

### Monitoring & Learning
- `src/monitoring/agent-monitor.ts` - Real-time agent activity monitoring
- `src/monitoring/agent-events.ts` - Agent event definitions
- `src/monitoring/agent-integration.ts` - Integration with monitoring systems
- `src/learning/feedback-store.ts` - User feedback and learning system

### Migration Support
- `src/migration/enhanced-mcp-server.ts` - Enhanced MCP server with DDD support
- `src/migration/parallel-adapter.ts` - Parallel execution of old and new implementations
- `src/migration/feature-flags.ts` - Feature flag management for gradual rollout

## Breaking Changes

None - This release maintains full backward compatibility.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed ESLint errors with unused variables (renamed to `_error` where appropriate)
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors with missing dependencies
- Fixed type mismatches in GitManager API
- Corrected undefined variable references in error handlers
- Fixed Express.js ParsedQs type handling

## Documentation

- Added comprehensive DDD architecture documentation
- Created monitoring guides and quick start documentation
- Added testing setup and demo scripts
- Improved API documentation with detailed examples

## Performance Improvements

- Optimized file watching with better event aggregation
- Improved Git operations with cached repository instances
- Reduced memory usage through better object lifecycle management
- Enhanced query performance with proper indexing strategies

## Developer Experience

- Better TypeScript types throughout the codebase
- Improved error messages with actionable suggestions
- Enhanced debugging with structured logging
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features

## Migration Guide

No migration required. All existing configurations and integrations will continue to work. To take advantage of new DDD features:

1. Update to v2.2.0: `npm install @jdrhyne/claude-code-github@2.2.0`
2. Optional: Enable new monitoring features in your config
3. Optional: Use new DDD-based commands through the enhanced API

## Future Deprecations

The following features will be deprecated in v3.0.0:
- Direct access to GitManager (use DDD commands instead)
- Legacy error types (use new domain errors)
- Non-typed command parameters (use typed commands)

## Contributors

Special thanks to all contributors who helped make this release possible through bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.
