- **GitHub Account** with Personal Access Token

## Installation

```bash
# No installation required - run on demand with npx
npx @jdrhyne/claude-code-github@latest

# Or install globally
npm install -g @jdrhyne/claude-code-github
```

## Configuration

### 1. First Run Setup

```bash
npx @jdrhyne/claude-code-github@latest
```

First run creates `~/.config/claude-code-github/config.yml` and exits. Edit this file:

```yaml
git_workflow:
  main_branch: main
  protected_branches: [main, develop]
  branch_prefixes:
    feature: feature/
    bugfix: bugfix/
    refactor: refactor/

projects:
  - path: "/Users/yourname/Projects/my-app"
    github_repo: "yourname/my-app"
    reviewers: ["teammate1", "teammate2"]
```

### 2. Intelligent Suggestions

Configure the intelligent workflow assistant to match your preferences:

```yaml
# Intelligent suggestion system configuration
suggestions:
  enabled: true                 # Master switch for all suggestions
  
  # Warn when working directly on protected branches
  protected_branch_warnings: true
  
  # Time-based reminders for uncommitted work
  time_reminders:
    enabled: true
    warning_threshold_minutes: 120    # High priority warning after 2 hours
    reminder_threshold_minutes: 60    # Medium priority reminder after 1 hour
  
  # Large changeset suggestions
  large_changeset:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 5                # Suggest commit when this many files are changed
  
  # Pattern recognition for optimal workflows
  pattern_recognition: true     # Recognize tests + implementation patterns
  pr_suggestions: true          # Suggest PR creation when branches are ready
  change_pattern_suggestions: true  # Suggestions for doc + code patterns
  branch_suggestions: true      # Suggest feature branches for new work
```

**Per-Project Overrides**: Add `suggestions:` block to any project to override global settings:

```yaml
projects:
  - path: "/Users/yourname/Projects/prototype"
    github_repo: "yourname/prototype"
    suggestions:
      enabled: false           # Disable suggestions for prototyping
  
  - path: "/Users/yourname/Projects/production-app"
    github_repo: "yourname/production-app"
    suggestions:
      time_reminders:
        warning_threshold_minutes: 30  # Faster pace for production work
      large_changeset:
        threshold: 3           # Smaller commits for production
```

### 3. GitHub Token

Create a token at [GitHub Settings ‚Üí Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo` and `workflow` scopes. The server will prompt for it on first use and store it securely in your system keychain.

### 4. Configure Claude Code

```bash
# Add the MCP server
claude mcp add claude-code-github npx -- -y @jdrhyne/claude-code-github@latest

# Verify it's working (run in a Git repository)
claude-code "What's the status of my current project?"
```
