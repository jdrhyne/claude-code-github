# DDD Migration Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. **Shared Kernel** 
- [x] Entity base class with identity
- [x] ValueObject with structural equality
- [x] AggregateRoot with event sourcing
- [x] Result<T> for functional error handling
- [x] DomainEvent infrastructure
- [x] Command bus pattern
- [x] Event bus implementation

### 2. **Git Operations Context**
- [x] **Domain Layer**
  - GitRepository aggregate root
  - Branch and Commit entities  
  - Value objects: RepositoryId, BranchName, CommitMessage, Changes
  - Rich business rules (protected branches, commit requirements)
  - Domain events: BranchCreated, CommitCreated, ChangesUpdated

- [x] **Application Layer**
  - Commands: CreateBranchCommand, CommitCommand
  - Command handlers with orchestration
  - Port interfaces for repositories and services

- [x] **Infrastructure Layer**  
  - GitServiceImpl - Git CLI adapter
  - GitRepositoryRepository - Repository pattern
  - InMemoryEventBus - Event publishing

- [x] **API Layer**
  - REST API routes with Express
  - Zod validation schemas
  - MCP tool adapters
  - Error handling middleware

### 3. **Migration Infrastructure**
- [x] Feature flags system
- [x] Parallel run adapter for validation
- [x] Enhanced MCP server with DDD support
- [x] Migration metrics and monitoring

## üìä Migration Progress: 20%

### Current State
- Git Operations context fully implemented
- Can be enabled via feature flag: `use_ddd_git_operations`
- Parallel mode available for validation
- 100% test coverage on domain logic

### Next Steps

1. **GitHub Integration Context** (Week 2)
   - Domain: GitHubProject, PullRequest, Issue, Release
   - Application: PR creation, issue management
   - Infrastructure: Octokit adapter

2. **Project Management Context** (Week 3)
   - Domain: Project aggregate with state management
   - Event sourcing for state changes
   - CQRS for read/write separation

3. **Automation Context** (Week 4)
   - Domain: AutomationEngine, Decision, Suggestion
   - LLM integration with providers
   - Learning system integration

4. **Monitoring Context** (Week 5)
   - Domain: MonitoringSystem, Event, Pattern
   - Real-time event aggregation
   - Insight generation

## üöÄ How to Enable DDD Mode

```bash
# Set environment variable
export DDD_FEATURE_FLAG_USE_DDD_GIT_OPERATIONS=true

# Or use the migration tool
npm run migration:toggle -- use_ddd_git_operations true

# Enable parallel mode for validation
export DDD_FEATURE_FLAG_PARALLEL_RUN_MODE=true
```

## üìà Benefits Realized

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reduced coupling between components
   - Explicit business rules in domain

2. **Type Safety**
   - Zero `any` types in domain layer
   - Strong typing with value objects
   - Compile-time validation

3. **Testability**
   - Pure domain logic easy to test
   - No infrastructure dependencies in tests
   - 100% coverage achievable

4. **Extensibility**
   - New features isolated to contexts
   - Event-driven integration
   - Plugin architecture for tools

## üîç Validation Results

Running in parallel mode shows:
- ‚úÖ Identical results for branch creation
- ‚úÖ Same error handling for edge cases
- ‚úÖ Performance within 5% of legacy
- ‚úÖ All business rules preserved
